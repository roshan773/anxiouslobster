# 🍏 Apple Website Clone

A high-fidelity, responsive clone of the official Apple website, built using **Next.js 14 App Router**.  
This project demonstrates my expertise in building modern, scalable, and performance-optimized web applications — closely replicating Apple’s minimalist design, smooth user experience, and robust architecture.

## ✨ Overview

This project recreates essential features of Apple's website:
- A visually striking homepage with hero sections.
- Dynamic and fully responsive product pages.
- Smooth navigation with optimized assets and best practices.
- Built with a focus on scalability, clean architecture, and SEO optimization.

## 🚀 Features

- **Next.js App Router**: Modern file-based routing system (`/app` directory) with layouts, nested pages, and server components.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Dynamic paths (e.g., `/iphone`, `/ipad`, `/mac`) with potential for dynamic parameters (e.g., `/products/[id]`).
- **Optimized Images**: Uses `next/image` for faster load times and responsive image handling.
- **Reusable Components**: Shared Navbar, Footer, Product Cards, and Section Components.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly and adaptive to all screen sizes, replicating Apple’s UX standards.
- **Performance-First Approach**: Leveraging Next.js built-in optimizations like Image optimization, route-based code splitting, and Turbopack for faster development builds.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** — App Router-based architecture
- **React 18** — Core frontend library
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling (optional: Bootstrap for some components if needed)
- **React Icons** — For Apple-style clean and modern icons
- **JavaScript** — Interactivity and dynamic rendering
- **Vercel** — (For deployment)
