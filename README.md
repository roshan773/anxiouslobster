# Apple Website Clone

A responsive web clone of Apple's official website, built with Next.js using the App Router. This project demonstrates my ability to create a modern, performance-optimized web application with a focus on clean design, dynamic routing, and user experience.

## Overview

This project replicates key features of Apple's website, such as a visually appealing homepage with a hero section, dynamic product pages, and a consistent navigation system. It leverages Next.js features like file-based routing, optimized image loading, and layouts to ensure scalability and performance.

### Features

- **File-Based Routing**: Utilizes Next.js App Router for intuitive navigation across pages (e.g., homepage, product pages).
- **Dynamic Product Pages**: Implements dynamic routes (e.g., `/products/[id]`) to showcase individual products like iPhones or MacBooks.
- **Optimized Images**: Employs `next/image` for efficient loading of high-quality product visuals.
- **Consistent Layouts**: Uses a root layout with shared `Navbar` and `Footer` components for a cohesive UI.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to mobile and desktop screens, mirroring Apple's user-friendly interface.

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and file-based routing.
- **React**: Component-based UI development.
- **CSS/Tailwind CSS**: Styling to achieve Apple's minimalist aesthetic (Tailwind used if configured).
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for interactivity and dynamic routing.
